# Guileless [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elektronaut/guileless.png)](https://travis-ci.org/elektronaut/guileless) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/elektronaut/guileless.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/elektronaut/guileless)

Guileless is a naive HTML preprocessor. It does three things:

1. Single line breaks are converted to `<br>`
2. Several consecutive line breaks are treated as paragraphs and wrapped in `<p>`
3. Converts stray `<`, `>`, and `&`s to HTML entities.

Why is this more useful than, say, Rails' built in `simple_format`?

Well, it's actually a real (if simplistic) HTML parser. It understands nested
tags, and will happily format text nodes inside `div`s and `blockquote`s.

However, it does **NOT** do any sanitation on the input.

## Installation

    gem install guileless

or add it to your gemfile:

    gem "guileless"

## Usage

```ruby
Guileless.format("<div>foo</div>") # => "<div><p>foo</p></div>"
```
